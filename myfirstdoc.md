# Digital Transformation
Over the past few years, we have witnessed the rapid digital transformation in the manufacturing sector due to the growth of information and communication technologies (ICT). Manufacturers are also facing numerous challenges with the traditional industrial process such as ever-changing consumer demands, market trends, and unplanned downtime, equipment failure, rapidly evolving business requirements. 
It helps to optimize the overall manufacturing process from product development to supply chain. The primary goal of such technologies is to improve operational efficiencies to a greater extent. Most importantly, digital transformation will be implemented through the augmentation of people, processes, culture, and things to bring value to the organization. Nevertheless, such investments help enterprises to maintain a competitive edge across industries in the world.  
>*By the end of 2022, it is expected that half of all manufacturers will be invested in advanced digital technologies like AI, IoT, and Robotics to drive smart manufacturing* 
# Key technologies for digital transformation
## Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
Industrial IoT is the core technology of the industry 4.0 revolution. The IoT is steadily growing in the wave of digital transformation. IIoT is an extension of IoT that can be formally defined as a network of smart sensors and actuators that helps to enhance the manufacturing process in industrial settings. The ultimate goal of IIoT is to enable more complex interaction between IT and Operational Technologies (OT) that are securely connected and controlled to deliver better business outcomes.
>*IoT in industrial settings have the potential to create as much as $3.7 trillion in value per year in 2025‚Äù- McKinsey report*

### IIoT enabled operation generally comprised of four crucial components including,
- Smart machines with built-in sensors and software for asset tracking and logging data.
- Cloud computer systems for storing a large amount of data from disparate sources.
- Advanced data analytics tools and platforms to make real-time decisions through analyzing huge troves of data.
- Skilled employees who can ensure proper manufacturing process
