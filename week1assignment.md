# Blockchain Empowered Smart Healthcare Systems
## Introduction
Over the past few years, the healthcare landscape has been revolutionized with the rapid growth of emerging technologies for healthcare monitoring. Digital transformation paves the way to facilitate personalized healthcare for patients. However, privacy and security become the primary concern while implementing sophisticated technologies in healthcare.  
Blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies of the next decade that will make patient records more efficient, secure, and, reliable. Blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for cyber security breaches and it ensures a secure way of transferring health records across various healthcare providers.  
The decentralized architecture of blockchain has become a crucial part of modern healthcare in multiple phases such as drug traceability, clinical trials and research, and Electronic Health Records (EHR) management. In this article, we briefly explained the role of blockchain in protecting the highly sensitive patient healthcare data which led to improving the overall healthcare outcomes.
## What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a kind of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and an immutable shared ledger that allows a secured way of recording all the transactions that are duplicated and distributed across the healthcare networks. In the healthcare context, patient health information is represented as transactions. This tamper-proof public ledger records the patient data and an identical copy of such records will be visible to all the participants in the network.   
Blockchain generates a cryptographic hash for individual blocks of patient health records. A blockchain is an unbreakable and unalterable chain of blocks. As a consequence, even a single illicit alteration will get reflected across the entire network which in turn makes the healthcare network highly trustworthy with greater transparency. The immutable shared ledger is responsible for validating all the blocks and transactions in a blockchain network through executing smart contracts and consensus mechanisms. If any block contains an error, it will be visible to all the network participants.

### Smart Contracts
A smart contract is a kind of simple program or agreement that is stored on a blockchain ledger. It will be automatically executed when the predefined conditions are met. Similarly, smart contracts eliminate the need for third-party intermediaries between buyer and seller which makes the entire blockchain network immutable and tamperproof.   
Smart contracts provide a wide range of benefits such as speed, efficiency, accuracy, trust, transparency, security, and savings.  Most importantly, it significantly reduces the risks and issues in the drug traceability which will increase the supply chain transparency.  
### Consensus Mechansims
Blockchain uses consensus mechanisms to ensure the data in the public ledgers are synchronized across all the nodes in the network. It also guarantees that all the transactions are legitimate and regularly verifies that every node is connected to the same network.  Likewise, consensus mechanisms confirm while adding a new block to the chain. As a result, it prevents malicious participants from attempting to alter the data which in turn makes the network highly fault-tolerant.   
There are different kinds of consensus mechanisms used in the healthcare domain including:  
- Proof of Work (PoW), 
- Proof of Stake (PoS), 
- Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), 
- Proof of Importance (PoI), 
- Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET),
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).   
Above all, PoW, PoS, and PBFT have been widely used for achieving consensus while performing the decentralized computation in blockchain-based healthcare systems.  
## Drug Traceability  
The inherent complexity of the healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain may pose serious limitations including inaccurate information, lack of transparency, and, lack of data provenance. Effective supply chain management in healthcare is crucial since the compromised supply chain has a serious adverse impact on patients’ health as well as causes a huge economic loss to the healthcare systems.   
The blockchain-based supply chain has the great potential to enhance end-to-end traceability, security, integrity, accountability, data provenance, and functionality of drug management. Moreover, blockchain minimizes the chances of counterfeiting and data theft issues due to its increased visibility and traceability among multiple stakeholders.  
## Bringing Clinical Trials & Research with Blockchain
Clinical trials and research are always vital for discovering new treatments for diseases and it provides a new way to detect, diagnose, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. However, some significant barriers arise which affect the secure and efficient sharing the patient data such as lack of trust, lack of interoperability, and limited accessibility of clinical trial data.  
Clinical trials are one of the primary benefits of blockchain due to its trusted, secure, automated, fault-tolerance capabilities. Blockchain radically reshapes the healthcare industry in the way patient data is stored, shared, and transacted. Smart contracts act as a key enabler to clinical trials and research that enforces privacy and security regulations between patients and healthcare stakeholders. Thus, it enables the patients themselves center of research as their medical history is aggregated and analyzed from different sources to explore new medical discoveries. Significantly, it enhances and optimizes the running of clinical trials by reducing the manual or core repetitive tasks through using smart contracts.    
As a result, a block-chain based system helps practitioners to make real-time decisions making in clinical trials. The immutable clinical trial data of blockchain enhances public trust and confidence in clinical research, resulting in safer medicine and ensuring data integrity for better healthcare outcomes.  
## EHR Data Management  
Traditional paper-based medical records are being transformed into digital registers known as Electronic Health Records (EHR). Patients and healthcare providers can access and manage the EHR records anywhere in the world to make timely decisions regarding patient care. EHR is an integral part of modern healthcare that contains a patient’s medical history, demographics, medications, vaccination details, diagnoses, allergies, laboratory test results, and radiology images.   
Nevertheless, EHR is constantly facing data security, integrity, and interoperability problems as the conventional methodologies are not adequate to handle such a massive amount of EHR records generated from disparate sources. Hence, the healthcare sector requires a more robust and resilient data-sharing infrastructure provided by Healthcare Information Exchange (HIE) which helps to overcome privacy and security vulnerabilities.   
Leveraging blockchain-based EHR systems can outperform well than existing centralized architecture in terms of accessibility, security, and scalability. The decentralized nature of blockchain could streamline the cost of implementation and transaction times due to its fewer overhead and intermediaries.

## Challenges and Limitations of Blockchain   
Though blockchain provides the intangible benefits, it has some significant challenges and limitations in the healthcare context.   
- *Lack of Interoperability* - Interoperability plays an essential role in enabling interaction among different blockchain networks. As there are no unified standards for blockchain, it may pose interoperability challenges when multiple blockchains are involved in the healthcare network that is based on different consensus mechanisms and smart contracts.  
- *Scalability* - Scalability is a significant challenge in blockchain implementation which impedes its mainstream adoption. Transaction costs, block size, limitations, and response time are the four critical issues that affect scalability.  
- *Lack of Standardization* - Ensuring blockchain technology fits every country’s privacy regulations and standards is incredibly challenging since there are no universal standards that could open up security vulnerabilities.  
## Conclusion
Undoubtedly, blockchain transforms the healthcare industry from centralized to distributed and decentralized systems which could drastically improve the healthcare quality. Meanwhile, this technology is still in earlier stages of development and requires more research and exploration. Ultimately, the healthcare industry continues to move forward by adopting blockchain initiatives as it is very likely to expand in the near future.
