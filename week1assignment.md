# Blockchain Empowered Smart Healthcare Systems
## Introduction
Over the past few years, the healthcare landscape has been revolutionized with the rapid growth of emerging technologies for healthcare monitoring. Digital transformation paves the way to facilitate personalized healthcare for patients. However, privacy and security become the primary concern while implementing sophisticated technologies in healthcare.  
Blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies of the next decade that will make patient records more efficient, secure, and, reliable. Blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for cyber security breaches and it ensures a secure way of transferring health records across various healthcare providers.  
The decentralized architecture of blockchain has become a crucial part of modern healthcare in multiple phases such as drug traceability, clinical trials and research, and Electronic Health Records (EHR) management. In this article, we briefly explained the role of blockchain in protecting the highly sensitive patient healthcare data which led to improving the overall healthcare outcomes.
## What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a kind of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and an immutable shared ledger that allows a secured way of recording all the transactions that are duplicated and distributed across the healthcare networks. In the healthcare context, patient health information is represented as transactions. This tamper-proof public ledger records the patient data and an identical copy of such records will be visible to all the participants in the network.   
Blockchain generates a cryptographic hash for individual blocks of patient health records. A blockchain is an unbreakable and unalterable chain of blocks. As a consequence, even a single illicit alteration will get reflected across the entire network which in turn makes the healthcare network highly trustworthy with greater transparency. The immutable shared ledger is responsible for validating all the blocks and transactions in a blockchain network through executing smart contracts and consensus mechanisms. If any block contains an error, it will be visible to all the network participants.
