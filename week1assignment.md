# Blockchain Empowered Smart Healthcare Systems
## Introduction
Over the past few years, the healthcare landscape has been revolutionized with the rapid growth of emerging technologies for healthcare monitoring. Digital transformation paves the way to facilitate personalized healthcare for patients. However, privacy and security become the primary concern while implementing sophisticated technologies in healthcare.  
Blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies of the next decade that will make patient records more efficient, secure, and, reliable. Blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for cyber security breaches and it ensures a secure way of transferring health records across various healthcare providers.  
The decentralized architecture of blockchain has become a crucial part of modern healthcare in multiple phases such as drug traceability, clinical trials and research, and Electronic Health Records (EHR) management. In this article, we briefly explained the role of blockchain in protecting the highly sensitive patient healthcare data which led to improving the overall healthcare outcomes.
## What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a kind of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and an immutable shared ledger that allows a secured way of recording all the transactions that are duplicated and distributed across the healthcare networks. In the healthcare context, patient health information is represented as transactions. This tamper-proof public ledger records the patient data and an identical copy of such records will be visible to all the participants in the network.   
Blockchain generates a cryptographic hash for individual blocks of patient health records. A blockchain is an unbreakable and unalterable chain of blocks. As a consequence, even a single illicit alteration will get reflected across the entire network which in turn makes the healthcare network highly trustworthy with greater transparency. The immutable shared ledger is responsible for validating all the blocks and transactions in a blockchain network through executing smart contracts and consensus mechanisms. If any block contains an error, it will be visible to all the network participants.

### Smart Contracts
A smart contract is a kind of simple program or agreement that is stored on a blockchain ledger. It will be automatically executed when the predefined conditions are met. Similarly, smart contracts eliminate the need for third-party intermediaries between buyer and seller which makes the entire blockchain network immutable and tamperproof.   
Smart contracts provide a wide range of benefits such as speed, efficiency, accuracy, trust, transparency, security, and savings.  Most importantly, it significantly reduces the risks and issues in the drug traceability which will increase the supply chain transparency.  
### Consensus Mechansims
Blockchain uses consensus mechanisms to ensure the data in the public ledgers are synchronized across all the nodes in the network. It also guarantees that all the transactions are legitimate and regularly verifies that every node is connected to the same network.  Likewise, consensus mechanisms confirm while adding a new block to the chain. As a result, it prevents malicious participants from attempting to alter the data which in turn makes the network highly fault-tolerant.   
There are different kinds of consensus mechanisms used in the healthcare domain including:  
- Proof of Work (PoW), 
- Proof of Stake (PoS), 
- Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), 
- Proof of Importance (PoI), 
- Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET),
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).   
Above all, PoW, PoS, and PBFT have been widely used for achieving consensus while performing the decentralized computation in blockchain-based healthcare systems.  
## Drug Traceability  
The inherent complexity of the healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain may pose serious limitations including inaccurate information, lack of transparency, and, lack of data provenance. Effective supply chain management in healthcare is crucial since the compromised supply chain has a serious adverse impact on patientsâ€™ health as well as causes a huge economic loss to the healthcare systems.   
The blockchain-based supply chain has the great potential to enhance end-to-end traceability, security, integrity, accountability, data provenance, and functionality of drug management. Moreover, blockchain minimizes the chances of counterfeiting and data theft issues due to its increased visibility and traceability among multiple stakeholders.  
## Bringing Clinical Trials & Research with Blockchain
Clinical trials and research are always vital for discovering new treatments for diseases and it provides a new way to detect, diagnose, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. However, some significant barriers arise which affect the secure and efficient sharing the patient data such as lack of trust, lack of interoperability, and limited accessibility of clinical trial data.
